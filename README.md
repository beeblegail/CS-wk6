For those who are interested in some programming extension, here are a few tasks you could try (if you’re thinking of doing Computer Science as an option for next year, you should really try at least the first one):
 
1.)    Verify an e-mail address
a.       The user inputs an e-mail address
b.       The program checks whether that e-mail address is valid
c.       The program outputs either VALID or INVALID
d.       For example:
·   order66@python.com – VALID
·   mr_boshoff@legitmail.co.uk – VALID
·   obiwan kenobi@theforce.com – INVALID
·   whoop@deedoo – INVALID
e.       SUPER_EXTENSION
·   The program tells the user what the mistake was
·   Such as, you forgot the “@” symbol or there was a space in the string etc…
f.        SUPER_DUPER EXTENSION
·   Allow the user to enter both the e-mail address and password
·   Don’t worry about encrypting or hiding the password yet
·   The program should verify that the password contains at minimum
·         A lowercase letter
·         An uppercase letter
·         A number
·         A symbol
·         7 characters
·   The program will output (in addition to checking the e-mail address), whether the password is VALID or INVALID
Have fun!
